Abstract: In this paper, we examine the effect of various contracts between a socially 

concerned airport and  an environmentally conscious airline  regarding their profitability and 

channel  coordination  under  two  distinct  settings.  First,  we  consider  no  government 

interventions,  while  in  the  second,  we  explore  government-imposed  taxations  to  curb 

emissions. Furthermore, we investigate the impact of passenger greening sensitivity, greening 

cost, and consumer surplus coefficient on conveyance fees, ticket fare, greening level and the 

channel  welfare.  Our  analysis  shows  that  the  revenue  sharing  and  linear  two-part  tariff 

contracts  coordinate  the  decentralised  airport-airline  channel.  Our  findings  also  reveal  that 

players’  greening  and  social  efforts  can  improve  both  the  welfare  and  efficiency  of  the 

channel  simultaneously.  Importantly,  under  government  interventions,  taxation  does  help 

improve  the  greening  level  of  the  channel  in  both  coordinating  and  non-coordinating 

contracts. However, the greening level in the non-coordinating contracts with taxation is still 

less than the coordinating contracts even without tax. Finally, we also extended the model to 

include  a  duopoly  airline  market  with  pricing  and  greening  competition.  We  analyze  the 

effect  of  competetiton  between  airlines  on  airport  utility,  airline  profit,  ticket  fare  and 

greening level.

Airports generate revenue from two sources, namely: (i) aeronautical activities1 and (ii) 

Introduction  

commercial activities2. The former is proportional to flight frequency and passenger traffic, 

while the latter depends only on passenger traffic (Chang et al., 2016; Zhang & Zhang, 1997). 

Therefore, increasing air traffic has led to a twofold rise in airport business, as its revenue has 

increased  from  both  sources  (Francis  et  al.,  2004).  However,  even  with  growing  demand, 

airlines  are  finding  it  difficult  to  maintain  their  profit  margins  with  rising  input  costs  and 

market  competition.  For  example,  the  US  airlines  faced  margin  reductions  of  5%  to  6%  in 

2018,  marking  the  third  straight  year  of  margin  contraction.  Unfortunately,  the  operating 

margins are expected to narrow further in the upcoming years (Stalnaker, 2019). Add to that 

the  ever-increasing  global  warming  concerns  that  has  led  policy  makers  to  introduce 

additional charges, such as emission taxes, which have effectively forced airlines to increase 

investments  in  efficient  and  green  technologies  to  reduce  carbon  emission  (Masiol  & 

Harrison, 2014). These investments have burdened the cost structure of the airlines, affecting 

their margins thereof. 

Notably, even though air transportation industry today, do recognise the significance of 

social and environmental aspects, (as captured in Munich-Lufthansa agreement and Norway's 

Oslo Airport and its signatory airline agreement discussed below) increasing operating costs 

leaves less room for airlines to engage in social and ecological activities concurrently. Due to 

this,  very  few  can  achieve  a  sustainable  growth  including  economic,  environmental,  and 

social  elements  altogether  (Elkington,  1998).  One  of  the  major  hindrances  to  attain 

sustainable  growth  is  the  lack  of  a  coherent  coordination  strategy  between  industry  agents 

(Ryder, 2014). For instance, in the aviation industry, an airline’s performance determines the 

airport’s demand, while the airport needs to facilitate the airline by providing the necessary 

                                                           
1 Aeronautical revenues are paid by airlines depending on the use of runways, terminals and gates, which are 
proportional to flight frequency. 
2 Commercial activity includes terminal concessions (duty-free shops, restaurants, etc.), car parking and rental, 
which are proportional to passenger traffic.

infrastructure. This inter-dependency has to be well coordinated, failure of which would lead 

to a limited economic growth, environmental protection and social development.  

Nevertheless,  the airline-airport  coordination seems  to  have picked up in  recent  times 

under  a  few  cases.  For  instance,  the  first  glimpse  of  a  contract  incorporating  the 

environmental  aspect  has  been  seen  in  the  Munich-Lufthansa  agreement.  Under  this 

agreement,  terminal  2  of  the  airport  has  been  exclusively  devoted  to  handling  Lufthansa’s 

operations,  which  in  turn  has  pledged  to  continue  investing  in  a  modern  fleet  with  fuel-

efficient aircrafts, aiming to bring its emission levels down by 25% (Noëth, 2019). Another 

example  of  vertical  coordination  is  Norway's  Oslo  Airport  and  its  signatory  airline;  the 

former encourages the airline to use sustainable aviation fuels for its operations by providing 

incentives.  The  use  of  biofuels  by  the  airline  has  resulted  in  significant  environmental 

benefits (Baxter, 2020). 

However,  incorporating  all  aspects  of  sustainable  growth  to  achieve  all-round 

development by using contracts, has altogether remained an unexplored area in the aviation 

sector. Based on the examples cited above, we note that there hasn’t been sufficient literature 

that  has  focused  on  exploring  the  importance  of  ‘coordination’  for  profitability,  planet 

(environmental) and people (social) in the airline industry. Thus, in this paper, we examine a 

dyadic  model  with  one  airline-one  airport  market  structure  with  a  single  origin-destination 

(OD)  route  and  explore  four  different  contract  types.  We  assume  that  the  airline  takes 

environmental  responsibility,  and  the  airport  is  involved  in  corporate  social  responsibility 

(CSR).  We  also  explore  the  effectiveness  of  government  intervention  under  these  four 

different  contracts.  Herein,  it  may  be  worth  noting  that  with  government  intervention,  the 

airline  pays  an  emission  tax,  which  in  turn  is  used  for  the  social  welfare  of  the  local 

community. Our motivation is to explore how airline-airport can support each other with the 

help of different contracts to achieve sustainable growth in the aviation sector. Primarily, we 

seek answers to the following questions: 

economic, environmental, and social results? 

(i) 

Under  what  circumstances  can  airport-airline  coordination  achieve  better 

(ii) 

What is the effect of environmental and social considerations on factors such 

as airport charges, ticket fares, and demand for air travel? 

(iii) 

How  can  the  use  of  contracts  enhance  mutual  support  and  eliminate  the 

(iv) 

What is the role of government intervention in achieving sustainable growth in 

problem of incoordination? 

the aviation sector?

(v) 

How does contract affect the duopoly airline market with greening and pricing 

competition to achieve better economic, environmental, and social results?  

Notably,  our  study  demonstrates  that  channel  performance  and  its  efficiency  improve 

when players engage in coordinating contracts instead of solely working for their individual 

goals  under  non-coordinating  contracts.  Interestingly,  players  achieve  a  higher  level  of 

greening and social welfare. Moreover, our findings show that revenue sharing and liner two-

part  tariff  contracts  perfectly  coordinate  the  airport-airline  channel.  Regarding  government 

intervention,  we  observe  that  taxation  does  help  improve  the  greening  level;  however,  it  is 

still  less  in  non-coordinating  contracts  with  government  intervention  than  coordinating 

contracts even without tax. We also find that the airline profit decreases with higher taxation 

and  higher  greening  investment  costs.  We  further  analyse  the  result  of  the  duopoly  airline 

market  with  pricing  and  greening  competition  and  undertake  sensitivity  analysis  to  support 

our findings.  

The remainder of the paper is organised as follows: Section 2 provides a brief review of 

channel  coordination  in  the  aviation  sector.  Section  3  proposes  a  model  with  airline  and 

airport’s objective functions without government intervention. Section 4 briefly explains the 

different  contract  types  that  are  studied.  Section  5  provides  analytical  results.  Section  6 

presents the numerical analysis of the equilibrium results. Section 7 extends the coordination 

model  by  considering  government  intervention,  and  Section  8  provides  a  summary  and 

conclusions. Finally, Section 9 provides future research directions.

Literature review  

This  manuscript  mainly  discusses  three  aspects:  coordination  between  airport  and 

airline, environmental concer and welfare concern. Therefore, in this section, we present their 

relevant literature and list the key research questions. We also compare this study with extant 

literature in Table 1.  

Before  liberalisation,  both  the  airlines  and  airports  were  owned  and  operated  by 

governments in many countries across the globe. They were public entities, and the need to 

explore  any  possible  coordination  strategies  between  the  two  were  ignored.  However,  with 

the increasing trend of deregulation, airports and airlines began to realise the need for vertical 

agreements (Fu et al., 2010). The studies of Fu & Zhang (2010) and Barbot (2009) found that 

cooperation between an airport and its airlines may be beneficial for both players in terms of 

increased traffic volume and operational efficiencies.  

As airports around the world are being commercialised, Starkie (2001) claimed that due 

to  an  increasing  focus  on  non-aeronautical  revenue,  airports  are  less  likely  to  charge  high 

 

4 

aeronautical  fees.  However,  Carney  &  Mew,  (2003)  seemed  to  differ;  they  argued  that  the 

monopolistic nature of the  airport  business, could  possibly encourage  the  airports  to  charge 

an exorbitant  aeronautical  fee.  Zhang  &  Zhang (2003)  along  with  Oum et  al.  (2004)  added 

that an increase in ‘aeronautical fee’ (or service charges, as they called it), might effectively 

reduce passenger footfall; hence, airports are apprehensive in increasing aeronautical charges. 

Herein  importantly,  both  growth  in  passenger  footfall  and  improvement  in  operational 

efficiency,  may  be  achieved  by  improved  airport-airline  coordination  (Auerbach  &  Koch, 

2007).  

Gillen  &  Morrison  (2003)  on  the  other  hand,  suggested  that  there  could  be  revenue-

sharing  contracts  between  airport-airline,  which  may  actually  internalise  non-aeronautical 

revenue  and  reduce  the  travelers’  total  travel  costs  thereof.  Fu  &  Zhang  (2010)  studied  the 

effects of revenue sharing; that is, an airport sharing a fraction of its non-aeronautical revenue 

with one or more airlines serving the airport. The airport offers the airline a ‘take it or leave 

it’ contract,  sharing thereby  a proportion of its  concession revenue. Nevertheless, the study 

did not consider aeronautical revenue, like landing fee and airport improvement fee. Alfonso 

(2012)  in  his  doctoral  thesis,  discussed  the  importance  of  ‘incentives’  in  a  coordination 

between airlines and airports. Specifically, he studied the airport pricing of aeronautical fee 

and  non-aeronautical  activities  and  confirm  a  positive  externality  of  non-aeronautical 

activities on the aeronautical charge. The author concluded that the airports have incentives to 

reduce the aeronautical charge so as to increase passengers’ dwell time and their consumption 

of concession goods. Czerny & Zhang (2015) studied revenues derived from non-aeronautical 

source and per-flight fees to find the optimal airport charges, with a condition of airport cost 

recovery. Choo (2014) showed that an increase in per-passenger charges is associated with a 

reduction  of  per-flight  costs;  however,  he  noted  that  there’s  a  possibility  of  vertical 

coordination, but fell short of discussing its associated benefits. Yang et. al. (2015) analysed 

airport–airline vertical arrangements using Nash bargaining game. They concluded that when 

there’s a vertical arrangement, the airlines would perform better if they have greater market 

power;  airports  would  perform  better  if  their  charges  are  higher,  or  the  airport  itself  cares 

about social welfare. Xiao et al. (2016) also did study the airport-airline vertical coordination; 

however,  they  used  the  airport’s  capacity  as  a  decision  variable  under  the  condition  of 

demand uncertainty. Thus, based on these few examples from extant literature, we note that 

while  most  of  the  studies  have  focused  on  profit  and  the  social  dimensions,  no  study  has 

effectively  considered  all  three  aspects  (i.e.  economic,  environmental  and  social)  of  triple 

bottom line (TBL) in the airline industry for a coordinated market setting. Moreover, we also 

 

5 

did not find any study in extant literature that has even looked to incorporate environmental 

issues in analysing the coordinating contracts in the industry.  

With an estimated 200% increase in the emission level, the environmental hazard of the 

airlines  industry  is  a  growing  area  of  concern  (Masiol  &  Harrison,  2014).  Albeit  limited, 

there  has  been  an  attempt  to  curb  emissions  in  recent  times  (Caro  et  al.,  2013).  Green 

economists  advocate  the  use  of  well-designed  carbon  tax  to  reduce  the  emission  levels 

significantly  (Lin  &  Lu,  2015).  In  fact,  they  vouch  for  policies  that  directly  target 

environmental goals via a Pigouvian tax or permit policies, which incidentally, are a common 

way  to  manage  environmental  problems.  However,  Sheu  &  Li  (2014)  noted  that  carbon 

permits/pricing is a reactive measure, while greening ‘investment’ is a proactive measure. In 

this study, we choose to discuss two settings; the first, wherein both airport and airline enter 

into  a  contract  to  promote  greening  investment  and  social  responsibility.  The  second,  we 

include  the  ‘government’,  which  imposes  a  tax  on  the  airline  for  its  carbon  emissions,  and 

uses the collected tax to improve the welfare of the local community. At their end, the airlines 

could reduce their long-term carbon emission by greening investment (GI), while cutting tax 

cost. Notably, GI includes investments in innovation, R&D in searching for fuel alternatives, 

upgrading fleet, and improving technology (Dray et al., 2014). Several studies in this regard 

have  suggested  that  airlines  must  be  incentivised  to  switch  from  conventional  fuels  to 

biofuels (Lu, 2018). The exemplary contract between Lufthansa and the Munich airport may 

be considered as a pioneering act in this regard. However, it would certainly be interesting to 

look into the aspect of ‘coordination’, and how it could help airlines improve their greening 

level, while drive the aviation market towards sustainability. We extend upon extant literature 

on  the  airport–airline  vertical  cooperation  considering  economic,  environmental,  and  social 

progress.  In  the  extant  literature  the  incorporation  of  all  three  aspects  (economic, 

environmental, and social) together is also referred as triple bottom line (TBL). We develop a 

vertical  airline-airport  model 

to 

improve  coordination  by  considering  economic, 

environmental, and social parameters. Some of the key features of our model are:  

(i) 

We  consider  a  greening  airline  that  invests  in  improving  its  greening  levels. 

We  try  to  explore  the  impact  of  greening  costs  and  green-sensitive  passengers  on  the 

profitability of the airline, utility of the airport and social welfare of the channel.  

(ii) 

The  welfare-maximising  airport  captures  the  people  (social)  aspect  of  the 

TBL,  which  contributes  to  consumer  surplus  attributed  to  corporate  social  responsibility 

(CSR). 

 

6 

(iii)  We  explore  four  different  contracts  to  identify  the  one  that  possibly  best 

coordinates the dyad to maximise the objectives of both the airport and the airline.  

(iv) 

We extended the model to include government intervention, where the airline 

pays an emission tax. We analyse and compare the results with and without tax regime. 

Importantly, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that has looked at the 

vertical  airline  industry,  while  incorporating  economic,  environmental,  and  social  aspects 

altogether.  Through  our  study,  we  show  that  airports  can  significantly  reduce  aeronautical 

charges, and also improve their utility. In fact, they could also help the airlines in increasing 

their greening level, which in turn would make up for a decrease in revenue from the reduced 

aeronautical  charges,  because  of  an  increased  passenger  count  that  would  hike  up  the  non-

aeronautical revenues. Interestingly, in the case of government levying tax on the airline, the 

greening  level  would  increase,  but  the  overall  channel  performance  would  significantly 

decrease.

3.1 Demand function: We consider demand (𝑞) to be a function of fare (𝑝), frequency 

(𝑓)  and  the  greening  level  (𝜃).  Passengers  generally  prefer  airlines  with  higher  flight 

frequency, as it helps in reducing schedule delays3. The higher greening level helps the airline 

to project an ecologically responsible image. Therefore, environmentally sensitive passengers 

rank  such  airlines  higher  in  terms  of  service  quality  (Laroche  et  al.,  2001),  and  have  the 

propensity to pay higher for such services (Yaacob & Zakaria, 2011). The demand function is 

downward  sloping  in  ticket  fare  and  upward  sloping  in  frequency  and  greening.  This 

assumption is similar to Brueckner & Girvin (2008) and Ghosh & Shah (2012). Thereby, the 

proposed demand equation is a function of the market potential (α), passenger's sensitivity to 

ticket fare (β), schedule-delay parameter (γ), passenger's sensitivity to greening (ξ), fare (𝑝), 

frequency (𝑓) and the greening level (𝜃), as shown below 

𝑞 = 𝛼 − 𝛽𝑝 −

+ 𝜉𝜃

3.2 Cost structure. We divide the airline cost structure into three parts:  

(i) 

Operating  cost  (OC).  We  assume  that  the  airline  incurs  an  average  per-

passenger  operating  cost  (𝑐𝐴𝐿),  which  is  equal  for  all  passengers.  Hence,  the  total  OC  is 

denoted by 𝑞. 𝑐𝐴𝐿; 

(ii) 

Greening  Investment  (GI)  cost:  As  the  airline  markets  its  services  as  being 

environmentally  friendly,  it  incurs  associated  higher  GI  cost  to  reduce  energy  consumption 

and emission. For example, the use of bio-fuel  reduces emission levels, but  are 2.5-6 times 

expensive than conventional fuel (IEA, 2019). The extra costs for switching from traditional 

fuel to biofuel is equivalent to 41% of the average one-way economy ticket fares (Lu, 2018). 

In case, the airline leases a fuel-efficient aircraft, the payback period varies from 5-9 years, 

depending on economic conditions (Tsai et. al., 2012). Though the greening initiative has an 

inherent cost, they are expected to reduce the emission levels, and thereby make the airlines 

more environment-friendly. 

                                                           
3 ‘Scheduled Delay’ is defined as the difference between the passenger’s preferred departure time and nearest 
flight time and is inversely proportional to the airline’s flight frequency 𝑓 (Richard, 2003).

The  cost  of  green  investment  is  assumed  to  be  non-linear  function,  given  by  𝐼. 𝜃2, 

where 𝐼 is an investment cost parameter and 𝜃 is the greening level that airline achieve. The 

cost is increasing and quadratic in nature with convex property, which reflects the idea that 

greening  firms  often  tend  to  capture  the  ‘low  hanging  fruits’  first  with  subsequent 

improvements becoming more difficult (Walley & Whitehead, 1994). Further, the return from 

R&D expenditures or large fleet investment is best captured by the convex costs attributed to 

diminishing  returns.  The  case  aptly  fits  into  our  model  as  green  improvement  is  achieved 

through large R&D based investments or fleet replacement (Bhaskaran & Krishnan, 2009).  

(iii) 

 Airport charges (AC). Airport charges are the revenue earned by the airport in 

exchange for services provided. We consider the two most important charges:  

Landing  fees:  The  airline  pays  a  fixed  charge  per  flight  and  the  total  cost  is 

Conveyance  fees  (CF):  Airports  charge  a  conveyance  fee  per  passenger  to 

cover  for  the  airport  infrastructure  development.  These  have  become  an  important  revenue 

source  for  airports  worldwide,  as  they  derive  revenue  equal  to  the  landing  fees  (Zhang  & 

Czerny, 2012).  For instance, the construction cost for Hong Kong airport’s third runway is 

partly covered by an increase in the per-passenger based airport charges. We define total CF 

as (𝑤. 𝑞), where 𝑤 is 𝐶𝐹 per passenger. Hence, the total airport charges are given by the sum 

of landing fees and conveyance fees, 𝑐. 𝑓 + 𝑤. 𝑞 

Finally,  the  profit  function  (𝜋)  of  the  greening  airline  is  defined  as  the  difference 

between revenue (𝑝.𝑞) and the total cost incurred;  

𝑃𝑟𝑜𝑓𝑖𝑡 (𝜋 𝐴𝐿) = (𝑝. 𝑞) − (𝐼. 𝜃2 + 𝑐. 𝑓 + 𝑤. 𝑞 + 𝑞. 𝑐𝐴𝐿) 
The airport’s revenues  come from  two sources:  aeronautical  revenue (CF and landing 

(2) 

 

 

 

charges) and non-aeronautical revenues (from duty-free shops, car hire/parking,  rental/retail 

shops and restaurants) (Bitzan & James, 2017). Aeronautical revenue is the sum of per flight 

charges  and  conveyance  fee  per  passenger.  While  non-aeronautical  revenue  is  the  average 

revenue  generated  per  passenger  by  using  extra  services  of  the  airport,  and  is  given  by  𝑤′. 
Thus, the total revenue of the airport is given by 𝑐. 𝑓 + (𝑤 + 𝑤′). 𝑞.  If 𝑐𝐴𝑃 is the operating 
cost  of  airport  per  passenger,  the  profit  of  airport  is  given  by  𝑃𝑟𝑜𝑓𝑖𝑡 (𝜋 𝐴𝑃) = 𝑐. 𝑓 + (𝑤 +
𝑤′). 𝑞 − 𝑞. 𝑐𝐴𝑃. To absolve the model from unnecessary variables, as like Barbot (2004), we 
also supposed that for non-aeronautical revenues, each passenger buys one unit of goods and 

services  at  the  airport,  and  that  their  price  is  equal  to  $1.  Then  if 𝑞 is  the  total  number  of 

passengers, the profit equation is modified as

CSR activities. CSR is the amount of welfare that the airport generates, and is a fraction 𝜇 of 

consumer surplus that it is willing to spend for CSR activity (Fu & Zhang, 2010). Consumer 

surplus  (CS)  in  turn,  is  the  difference  between  the  worth/value  of  the  service  consumers 

receive  and  the  price  that  they  pay.  Therefore,  CS  is  given  by  ∫

The  CS  fraction  𝜇  allows  us  to  define  the  objective  function  of  a  utility-maximising 

airport  as  a  weighted  sum  of  profit  and  CSR.  𝜇=0  signifies  that  the  airport  is  a  pure  profit 

maximiser,  whereas  𝜇=1  indicates  that  the  firm  is  the  perfect  CSR  maximiser.  Airport’s 

weighted objective function is given by 

𝑈𝐴𝑃 = ( 1 − 𝜇) 𝜋 𝐴𝑃 + 𝜇

Thereby, we capture all three elements (economic, environmental, and social) with the 

airline as a profit maximiser with environmental responsibilities, and the airport as a utility 

maximiser with social responsibility. In section 4, we develop models for the centralised case 

and various other contract structures.  

Centralised Case and Various Contract Structures 

4. 

4.1 

Centralised Case 

Under  the  centralised  airport-airline  structure,  there  is  a  single  decision-maker  that 

decides  the  optimal  conveyance  fees,  ticket  fare,  and  the  greening  level.  In  ‘coordination’ 

literature, the centralised case provides benchmark solution. Examples from real life include 

the  Koh  Samui  Airport,  Thailand,  which  effectively  is  owned  and  operated  by  Bangkok 

Airways.  Both  the  airport  and  the  airline  cooperate  among  each  other  to  implement  joint 

decisions. Another example includes the terminal 5 of Kuwait International Airport, which is 

exclusively operated by Jazeera Airways. We model centralised structure where the objective 

of the central planner is to maximise the social welfare (SW), given by the sum of airline and 

airport objectives (𝐸𝑞. 2 + 𝐸𝑞. 5), and find a globally optimal solution. The objective function 

𝑆𝑊𝐶𝐸𝑁𝑇 = (1 − 𝜇)(𝑝𝑞 − 𝑐𝐴𝑃𝑞 − 𝑐𝐴𝐿𝑞 + w′𝑞 − 𝐼𝜃2) + 𝜇𝑞2/2𝛽 

 

 

(6) 

is given as: 

 

11 

As discussed, the optimal solutions of a centralised case act as benchmark solution for 

contract, which is discussed further. Importantly, the performance of contracts are evaluated 

using 2 parameters, i.e. social welfare efficiency, with a ratio of 𝑆𝑊/𝑆𝑊𝐶𝐸𝑁𝑇 and greening 

efficiency, with 𝜃/𝜃𝐶𝐸𝑁𝑇. 

4.2 Decentralised channel (D-CENT) 

We now analyse a decentralised structure by considering economic, environmental, and 

social dimensions. The structure represents the case wherein both the airport and the airline 

act as different entities with no coordination whatsoever. It is best represented by the example 

of Kolkata International  Airport, India. Herein, in addition to the landing fees charged on a 

per-flight basis, the airport charges a conveyance fee of $17 for each international passenger, 

and $7 for each domestic passenger. The airport does provide essential services to airlines to 

facilitate  operation,  and  charge  a  fee  for  its  services.  It  announces  landing  fees  and 

conveyance fees (CF) beforehand,  and thus  undertakes the Stackelberg leader’s  role. Based 

on this information, in the second stage, the airline as the Stackelberg follower, chooses the 

level of greening (𝜃) and ticket fare (𝑝). Interestingly, the notion of the airport as leader, and 

airline  as  follower  has  also  been  used  by  Xiao  et  al.  (2016),  while  discussing  an  airport's 

capacity in  airport-airline vertical  coordination.  Furthermore,  Zhang  et  al.  (2010) and  Fu & 

Zhang  (2010)  also  under  the  very  same  context,  analysed  the  effects  of  airport  concession 

revenue  sharing  on  an  airline’s  social  welfare.  The  optimal  solutions  are  thereby  derived 

using  backward  induction.  Herein,  the  airline’s  objective  function  is  to  maximise  its  profit 

𝜋 𝐴𝐿 = 𝑝𝑞 − 𝑤𝑞 − 𝑐𝑓 − 𝐼𝜃2 − 𝑐𝐴𝐿𝑞. The first and second-order conditions are given by:  

𝑑𝜋𝐴𝐿
𝑑𝑝

=

0; 

𝑑𝜋𝐴𝐿
𝑑𝜃

= 0; 

𝑑2𝜋𝐴𝐿
𝑑𝑝2 < 0; 

𝑑2𝜋𝐴𝐿
𝑑𝜃2 < 0.  Taking  the  above-obtained  value  as  input,  the  airport 

maximises its utility 𝑈𝐴𝑃 = (1 − 𝜇)𝜋 𝐴𝑃 + 𝜇𝑞2/(2𝛽), to obtain the optimal CF.  

4.3 Cost-sharing contract (CSC) 

Greening  investment  requires  considerable  financial  support  in  the  initial  days,  with 

long gestation  period;  it could be in  the form  of R&D investment,  and/or procurement of  a 

new  and  efficient  fleet.  Notably,  a  single  player  with  such  exposure,  does  face  the  risk  of 

capital loss. Consider the case of the Indian Low-cost carrier, Indigo. The airline updated its 

fleet  with  more  fuel-efficient  aircrafts,  and  placed  the  largest  one-time  order  worth  $30 

billion  to  procure  a  fleet  of  A320neo  aircrafts.  However,  soon  after  receiving  the  fleet,  it 

faced engine failure due to technical glitches and was forced to ground its new aircraft. The 

company witnessed a decline in capacity growth up to 25% in 2019, and an estimated 10% 

 

12 

decline for next year (Kotoky & Philip, 2019). Thus, investments in greening has its inherent 

financial risks, like fault in procurement (or modification) of green aircraft or failure in R&D. 

High uncertainty and risks associated with new investments, do require firms to pool in their 

resources, and enter into joint-development contracts (Bharskaran & Krishnana, 2009). 

Under  such  a  scenario,  we  would  like  to  propose  a  CSC  solution,  so  that  the  airline 

shares  a  fraction  of  its  greening  investment  cost  with  the  airport  in  order  to  reduce  the 

inherent  risks.  Let  us  presume  that  the  airport  also  offers  to  share  the  investment  cost  to 

encourage  the  airline  to  undertake  greening  initiatives.  Thus,  it  shares  a  fraction  of  the 

greening cost (0 < 𝜙 < 1), while the airline pays the rest (1 − 𝜙). The airline’s objective is 
given  by  𝜋 𝐴𝐿 = 𝑝𝑞 − 𝑤𝑞 − 𝑐𝑓 − (1 − 𝜙)𝐼𝜃2 − 𝑐𝐴𝐿𝑞,  while  the  airport’s  objective  is  to 
maximise utility, given by  𝑈𝐴𝑃 = (1 − 𝜇)𝜋 𝐴𝑃 + 𝜇𝑞2/(2𝛽), where 𝜋 𝐴𝑃 = 𝑐𝑓 + (𝑤 + 1)𝑞 −

𝑐𝐴𝑃𝑞 − 𝜙𝐼𝜃2. The cost-sharing fraction is obtained by solving 

𝑑𝑈𝐴𝑃
𝑑𝜙

= 0. 

4.4 

Revenue-sharing contract (RSC) 

In  RSC  between  two  players,  the  downstream  player  agrees  to  share  its  revenue  with 

the upstream player, in return for a lower price for the service/product procured. We model 

RSC such that an airline shares 𝜓 fraction of its revenue with  the airport in return of lower 

CF  charges  by  the  airport.  The  remaining  1 − 𝜓  of  the  revenue  is  kept  by  the  airline.  This 

decrease  in  airport  charges,  helps  the  airline  to  divert  its  available  funds  to  make  greening 

investments.  Under  this  contract,  both  airport  and  airline  share  uncertainties  and  risks  of 

green investment. Herein notably, the airlines maximises its profit, as represented by 𝜋 𝐴𝐿 =
𝜓𝑝𝑞 − 𝑤𝑞 − 𝑐𝑓 − 𝐼𝜃2 − 𝑐𝐴𝐿𝑞;  while  the  airport  maximises  ‘utility’,  as  given  by  𝑈 𝐴𝑃 =

(1 − 𝜇)𝜋 𝐴𝑃 + 𝜇

, where 𝜋 𝐴𝑃 = 𝑐𝑓 + (𝑤 + 1)𝑞 − 𝑐𝐴𝑃𝑞 + (1 − 𝜓)𝑝𝑞.

2𝛽

4.5 

Linear two-part tariff (LTT) 

We now propose an LTT contract between an airport and an airline with an economic, 

environmental,  and  social  dimensions.  Consider  the  example  of  the  Dallas  International 

Airport,  US,  where  the  revenue  that  exceeds  the  airport’s  operating  cost  is  shared  among 

signatory  airlines.  The  airport  keeps  only  a  fixed  revenue  to  cover  its  costs.  We  examine  a 

similar case;  however, in  our model, the  airline  retains its reserved profit, and transfers the 

rest to the airport as a lump-sum tariff. Since the airline undertakes greening investment by 

entering into LTT agreement with the airport, it reduces the risk of its profit decline, which 

may  occur  due  to  uncertainties  in  return  from  green  investments.  Hence,  the  LTT  contract 

helps the airline to earn a constant profit, while undertaking the financial risk of greening.  

 

13 

To  find  the  optimal  ticket  fare  and  greening  level,  we  solve  the  airline’s  objective 
function,  given  by  𝜋 𝐴𝐿 = 𝑝𝑞 − 𝑤𝑞 − 𝑐𝑓 − 𝐼𝜃2 − 𝑐𝐴𝐿𝑞 − 𝐿,  while  to  find  optimal  CF  and 
lump-sum tariff to be paid, we solve the airport’s objective, given by  𝑈 𝐴𝑃 = (1 − 𝜇)𝜋 𝐴𝑃 +
𝜇𝑞2/(2𝛽), where 𝜋 𝐴𝑃 = 𝑐𝑓 + (𝑤 + 1)𝑞 − 𝑐𝐴𝑃𝑞 + 𝐿. 

5. 

Analytical Results 

In this section, we provide analytical insights to illustrate the findings of our paper. We 

solve  the  cases  discussed  above  to  obtain  the  optimal  equilibrium  values  (Table  3).  we 

formulate a two-stage Stackelberg game involving the airport, and the airline. Airport is the 

leader  and  decide  the  conveyance  fee,  after  which  the  airline  decides  the  ticket  fare  and 

greening  level.  The  model  is  solved  using  backward  induction.  The  detailed  solution  and 

steps are provided in online appendix.  

We  find 

that  under 

the  centralised  case, 

the  condition  for 

joint  concavity 

of 𝑆𝑊𝐶𝐸𝑁𝑇(𝑝, 𝜃) are:  (i) 𝐼 >

𝜉2(1−𝜇)
2𝛽(2−3𝜇)

(ii) 𝜇 ∈ (0,

2
). Condition (i) provides a lower limit for 
3

the greening cost  (𝐼), and signifies that the airline  would have to invest a certain minimum 

amount  to  achieve  greening.  It  suggests  firms  to  take  higher  greening  actions  if  passengers 

are  concerned  for  the  environment.  Hence,  in  countries  where  passengers  make  conscious 

decisions in favor of environmental-friendly services, the airline would tend to invest more in 

green  technologies.  The  second  term  𝜇 ∈ (0,

2
)  provides  the  range  of  CS  coefficient  for 
3

which the condition of concavity holds. 

From  the  equilibrium  result  of  the  centralised  case,  we  observe  that,

On  comparing  the  social  welfare  (SW)  (sum  of  airline  and  airport  objectives)  across 

contracts, we find that; 

Proposition  1:  In  the  case  of  airport-airline  coordination  with  the  economic, 

environmental, and social considerations, the social welfare of the channel follows the order 

𝑆𝑊𝐿𝑇𝑇 = 𝑆𝑊𝑅𝑆𝐶 = 𝑆𝑊𝐶𝐸𝑁𝑇 > 𝑆𝑊𝐷−𝐶𝐸𝑁𝑇 > 𝑆𝑊𝐶𝑆𝐶

From the above proposition, we conclude that SW of the channel under RSC and LTT 

contracts is equal to the centralised case and is always higher than D-CENT and CSC. RSC 

and  LTT  contracts  coordinate  with  the  centralised  structure,  with  social  welfare  efficiency4

Proposition  2:  In  the  case  of  airport-airline  coordination  with  the  economic, 

environmental,  and  social  considerations,  the  optimal  value  of  conveyance  fees  follows  the

Proposition  2  indicates  that  the  conveyance  fee  (CF)  is  highest  for  non-coordinating 

CSC followed by D-CENT. Under CSC, since the airport shares 33% of the airline’s greening 

investment costs, it charges higher CF to cover its expenses. The cost incurred by the airport 

in  CSC  is  thereby  higher  than  D-CENT,  leading  to  higher  CF  thereof.  For  coordinating 

contracts,  the  airline  either  shares  a  fraction  of  its  revenue  or  pays  a  tariff  to  the  airport  in 

return of  a reduced CF.  Under RSC, the airport  charges  a  minimum  CF, followed by  LTT, 

𝑤𝐿𝑇𝑇 > 𝑤𝑅𝑆𝐶. On comparing the optimal CF in D-CENT and CSC (Table 3), we find that CF 
is an increasing function of 𝑐𝐴𝑃 and is always higher than 𝑐𝐴𝑃 under the condition 𝜉2 > 3𝛽𝐼 

for D-CENT and 𝜇 <

32𝛽𝐼−9𝜉2
30𝛽𝐼−9𝜉2 for CSC.   

Proposition 3: For the airport-airline coordination with the economic, environmental, 

and  social  considerations,  the  optimal  value  of  greening  level  follows  the  following  order: 

                                                           
4 Social welfare efficiency (SWE) is defined as the ratio of the sum of profits of the airline and the utility of the 

airport divided by the social welfare of the centralized case; 
5 Greening efficiency (GE) is defined as the ratio of the greening level in any case divided by the greening level 
in the centralized case;

2𝛽𝐼(4 − 5𝜇). 

Proposition  3  suggests  that  for  coordinating  contracts  (RSC  and  LTT),  the  optimal 

greening  level  is  equal  to  that  of  a  centralised  case,  and  is  higher  than  CSC  and  D-CENT. 

When an airport and an airline agree to coordinate with each other, i.e. the airline shares its 

revenue in RSC, along with a sharing a lump-sum tariff in LTT in lieu of lower upfront CF, 

the airline can provide service with a higher greening level (Proposition 2). Otherwise, in the 

decentralised  case,  with  non-coordinating  contracts,  the  greening  level  is  lower.  Therefore, 

the system can only achieve economic, environmental, and social progress with appropriately 

chosen coordination contracts.  

Proposition 4: For the airport-airline coordination with the economic, environmental, 

and social considerations, the optimal value of ticket fare follows the following order: 𝑝𝐶𝑆𝐶 >

𝑝𝐷−𝐶𝐸𝑁𝑇 > 𝑝𝐶𝐸𝑁𝑇 = 𝑝𝐿𝑇𝑇 = 𝑝𝑅𝑆𝐶

] > 1,  while  the  optimal 

passenger  demand  is  of  the  order    𝑞𝐶𝐸𝑁𝑇 = 𝑞𝐿𝑇𝑇 = 𝑞𝑅𝑆𝐶 > 𝑞𝐶𝑆𝐶 > 𝑞𝐷−𝐶𝐸𝑁𝑇  if  condition 

16𝛽𝐼 > 5𝜉2 holds. 

From  proposition  4,  we  observe  that  the  ticket  fare  has  an  order  similar  to  CF. 

Interestingly,  it  is  higher  for  CSC  and  D-CENT  than  the  centralised  channel,  the  airline 

passes  on  the  part  of  increased  CF  to  passengers  by  charging  higher  ticket  fares.  While  in 

CSC,  higher  CF  leads  to  higher  ticket  fare  (𝑝𝐶𝑆𝐶 > 𝑝𝐷−𝐶𝐸𝑁𝑇);  however,  the  demand  is  still 

higher than the D-CENT case  (𝑞𝐶𝑆𝐶 > 𝑞𝐷−𝐶𝐸𝑁𝑇), because the airline shares its greening cost 

with  the  airport  in  CSC,  due  to  which  its  greening  level  rises,  thereby  leading  to  higher 

demand from environmentally conscious travelers (Proposition 3). The ticket fare is equal in 

RSC  and  LTT  (𝑝𝑅𝑆𝐶 = 𝑝𝐿𝑇𝑇),  but  is  lower  as  compared  to  CSC  and  D-CENT.  The  higher 

level of greening in both RSC and LTT (Proposition 3) also leads to an increase in passenger 

demand  as  compared  to  CSC  and  D-CENT.  Herein,  the  airport  earns  a  higher  non-

aeronautical revenue from increased passenger footfall, which in turn compensates its lower 

revenue due to lower CF (Proposition 2). Hence, the channel achieves a higher greening level 

and demand in case of both RSC and LTT.  

As the social welfare of RSC is equal to LTT (proposition 1), we compare the profit of 

airport and airline for both the contracts. Analytical analysis of both RSC and LTT provides 

us with the conditions for which 𝜋𝐿𝑇𝑇
offers  insights  on  revenue  sharing  fraction  (proposition  5).  To  have  analytically  tractable

Proposition  5(a)  suggests  a  feasible  range  of  the  revenue  sharing  fraction  𝜓 under 

which, the airline would have a higher profits in LTT as compared to RSC. However, for the 

airport  to  have  a  higher  profit  in  LTT  as  compared  to  RSC,  the  range  of  𝜓  is  given  by 

proposition  5(b),  which  is  mutually  exclusive  to  5(a).  We  observe  thereby  differing 

preferences between the choice of RSC and LTT contracts for both the airport and the airline

Both  RSC  and  LTT  contracts  between  an  airline  and  airport  help  in  channel 

coordination by reducing ticket fares, increasing the demand, greening level, and improving 

the airline’s profit. The total social welfare of the contracts is equal to that of the centralised 

case. Specifically, in RSC, the airline’s profit depends on RSF, while in LTT, the airline only 

keeps its reserved profit.  

We now analyse our results for the two extreme scenarios, S1 and S2. These scenarios 

allow  us  to  simplify  the  complex  results  and  provide  better  insights  into  the  analytical 

solution.  In  Scenario  1  (S1)  →  Passengers  are  green  sensitive  and  airline  undertakes 

greening, but the airport does not consider CSR (𝜇 →  0;  𝜉 ≠ 0); while in Scenario 2 (S2) → 

Airport  undertakes  CSR,  but  passengers  are  not  sensitive  to  the  greening  activities  of  the 

airline (𝜇 ≠ 0;  𝜉 →  0).  

Scenario 1 (S1): In scenario 1 (𝜇 →  0;  𝜉 ≠ 0) the condition for joint concavity takes 

the form:  𝐼 >

, which is  the  lower limit  for  greening cost  (I). The optimal  channel  profit 

𝜉2

and  SW  obtained  are  equal  for  the  centralised  contract  and  given  as;  𝜋𝐶𝐸𝑁𝑇 = 𝑆𝑊𝐶𝐸𝑁𝑇 =

  as 𝜇 →  0.  Notably  herein,  the  optimal  SW,  greening  level,  and  passenger 

demand  are  lower  as  compared  to  the  case  of  the  airport  with  CSR  responsibility  (𝜇 > 0).

This  result  signifies  that  CSR-oriented  airports  help  in  improving  channel  greening  and 

demand.  For  D-CENT  contract,  on  the  other  hand,  we  find  𝑤𝐷−𝐶𝐸𝑁𝑇 =

, 

where 𝐶𝐹 is an increasing function of the airport’s operating cost. Analysing CSC, we find 

that CF increases when the airport gives up passenger CSR, and chooses to focus only on its 

profit. While in the case of RSC, the optimal CF charged is  given by  𝑤𝑅𝑆𝐶 = (𝑐𝐴𝐿 + 𝑐𝐴𝑃 −

1)𝜓 − 𝑐𝐴𝐿.  Importantly,  since  CF  is  independent  of  the  greening  sensitivity  of  passengers 

along  with  the  investment  costs,  the  airline  increases  its  profit,  as  greening  increases  the 

demand without an increase in CF. In LTT on the other hand, when the airport is a pure profit 

maximiser (𝜇 →  0), we have 𝑤𝐿𝑇𝑇 = 𝑐𝐴𝑃 − 1. Importantly, we observe that for all contracts, 

CF is an increasing function of the airport’s operating cost. The analytical description of the 

findings  for  scenario  1  is  presented  in  below  proposition  6  and  7.  To  further  simplify  the 

comparison and gain better insights, we assume passenger schedule delay (𝛾) to be negligible 

for  proposition  6,  7  and  8.  However,  the  following  propositions  hold  even  for  the  general 

case, as shown in numerical analysis (section 6). 

Proposition  6:  In  scenario  1  of  airline-airport  coordination,  when  airport  gives  up 

CSR,  and  passenger  schedule  delay  is  assumed  to  be  negligible,  the  impact  of  passenger’s

We observe that an increase in the ‘greening sensitivity’ of passenger, drives an airline 

to  undertake  more  greening  investments  to  improve  its  greening  level  and  capture  higher 

demand (proposition 6a). Notably, airlines with higher greening level are also able to charge

19 

higher  ticket  fares  (proposition  6b),  increasing  thereby  their  profits  (proposition  6c).  Also, 

higher  passenger  demand  leads  to  an  increase  in  the  airport’s  revenue  (proposition  6d). 

However,  we  note  that  the  optimal  greening  level  decreases  with  higher  greening 

costs (proposition 7a). The higher greening cost leads to decrease in ticket fare (proposition 

7b)  because  airlines  invests  less  in  greening  due  to  higher  cost  and  could  not  charge  any 

premium  from  environmental  sensitive  passengers,  thereby  airlines  profit  also  goes  down 

(proposition 7c). Importantly, if the airline is willing to keep a higher greening level, its total 

investment cost (𝐼𝜃2) increases, leading to reduced profits, while a lower greening level leads 

to reduced airport’s profit (proposition 7d) with a dip in the passengers’ footfall.  

Scenario 2: In scenario 2 (S2) (𝜇 ≠ 0;  𝜉 →  0), the optimal SW for the centralised case 

is  given  by  𝑆𝑊𝐶𝐸𝑁𝑇 = Δ1

2(𝜇−1)2
2𝛽𝑓2(2−3𝜇)

;  the  channel  profit  is  𝜋𝐶𝐸𝑁𝑇 =

𝐼(4𝛽𝐼−8𝛽𝐼𝜇)(1−𝜇)(𝛥1)2
𝑓2(4𝛽𝐼−6𝛽𝐼𝜇)2

.  We 

find  that  𝑆𝑊μ≠0; 𝜉≠0 > 𝑆𝑊μ≠0; 𝜉→0;  which  implies  that  SW  is  maximum  when  the  system 

undertakes both greening and CSR. Further, we observe that for the centralised case, channel 

profit  is  a  decreasing  function  of  CSR  weightage  𝜇  (∂𝜋𝐶𝐸𝑁𝑇/∂𝜇  <  0),  whereas  total  social 

welfare is an increasing function of 𝜇 (∂𝑆𝑊𝐶𝐸𝑁𝑇/∂ 𝜇 > 0). The analytical results for scenario 2 

is presented in below proposition 8.  

Proposition  8:    In  scenario  2  of  airline-airport  coordination,  when  an  airport  is 

socially responsible, passenger  schedule delay is assumed to  be negligible,  and passengers 

are not green-sensitive, the following results hold true:

We find that CSC performs similar to the D-CENT channel when 𝜉 → 0, as the airline 

has no greening investment cost, and there is no cost-sharing between airport-airline. We also 

note  that  for  all  contracts,  CF  along  with  the  ticket  price  decrease  with  the  airport’s  CSR 

efforts  (proposition  8a  &  8b).  Importantly,  the  decrease  in  ticket  price  may  also  be  due  to 

lower CF.  Furthermore,  we  note  that  an increase in  CSR responsibility by  the  airport, does 

lead to higher airline profit (proposition 8c). Overall, this analysis shows that when airports 

become  more  CSR-oriented,  it  hurts  its  own  profitability  (proposition  8d),  but  on  the  other 

hand, is more beneficial both for customers (due to lower ticket price) and the airline (due to 

lower CF).

Numerical Analysis 

To  further  illustrate  the  theoretical  results,  in  this  section,  we  perform  a  numerical 

analysis to gain further insights by changing certain parameter values. Notably, the values are 

chosen in a way to satisfy the conditions of profit and utility function concavity, along with 

demand  functions  positivity  (conditions  are  provided  in  the  online  appendix  B1).  The 

parameter chosen are also in-line with the studies of Girvin (2010) and Brueckner & Girvin 

(2008)  and  satisfy  the  assumptions  of  model.  The  parameters  values  are: 𝛼 = 100;  𝛽 =

0.5;  𝛾 = 0.2;  𝑓 = 5;  𝜉 = 3;  𝑐 = 30;  𝐼 = 12; 𝑐𝐴𝐿 = 20; 𝑐𝐴𝑃 = 45;  µ = 0.18;  𝜓 = 0.82; 𝜃0 =
6.5;  𝜙 = 0.33;  𝜋̅ 𝐴𝐿 = 2500. 

Using  above  mentioned  numerical  values  for  D-CENT  contract,  we  obtain  𝑆𝑊𝐸 =

 70% 𝑎𝑛𝑑 𝐺𝐸 = 45%, leading to lower channel performance as compared to centralised case 

(Figure 1). In CSC, the optimal value of 𝜙 is found to be 0.33, with 𝑆𝑊𝐸 = 69% 𝑎𝑛𝑑 𝐺𝐸 =

73.8%.  Channel  efficiency  is  highest  for  LTT  and  RSC,  as  both  contracts  coordinate,  with 

SWE and GE equal to that of a centralised case (Figure 1). As observed from Figure 1, SW 

increases with higher CS coefficient (𝜇) and greening sensitivity of passengers  (𝜉). Further, 

the system generates the highest SW when an airline undertakes greening, ‘doing nothing’ is 

the worst possible strategy for the airline (Table 4).

Herein,  we  analyse  the  impact  of  greening  sensitivity  of  passengers (𝜉)  by  varying  𝜉 

from 0 to 3. The change in utility and profit of the airport and airline w.r.t. 𝜉 are shown in 

Figure  2  (a,  b,  c).  We  observe  that  for  a  given  value  of  parameters,  the  pure  profit  of  an 

airport and an airline along with the utility of the airport increases over a range of 𝜉. We note 

that the airport earns a higher pure profit in both CSC and D-CENT contracts, as it charges 

higher  CF  (Figure  2b).  For  comparing  the  coordinating  contracts,  we  find  that  the  LTT 

contract  yields  a  higher  airport  utility  and  profit  when  𝜉 > 1.5,  and  hence,  it  would  be  the 

preferred  contract  by  the  airport,  wherein  the  customers  are  environment-conscious.  The 

effect of passenger greening sensitivity on the airline’s optimal profit is presented in  Figure 

2(c). Here, we note that for 𝜉 > 1.5; 𝜋𝑅𝑆𝐶

𝐴𝐿 > 𝜋𝐿𝑇𝑇

𝐴𝐿
𝐴𝐿 > 𝜋𝐷−𝐶𝐸𝑁𝑇

> 𝜋𝐶𝑆𝐶

𝐴𝐿 . Further, we observe a 

fall in the airline’s profit when 𝜉 > 2.8 for CSC, which signifies that investment in greening 

beyond  a certain threshold, does  have a negative marginal return, as  the  total  greening cost 

(𝐼𝜃2) increases exponentially. We conclude thereby that RSC contract performs better for the 

airline, as it generates  higher profit, and  thus  would  be preferred over  LTT. Hence,  we can 

affirm  that  channel  conflicts  do  exist  for  𝜉 > 1.5,  as  the  airport  prefers  LTT,  as  it  looks  to 

maximise both profit and utility, while the airline prefers RSC.  

Figure 2 (a, b, c): Airport Utility, Airport Profit, Airline Profit vs. Greening Sensitivity of Passengers 

 

 

23 

Studying the effect of 𝜉 on CF, we find that CF decreases with increasing values of  𝜉 

(Figure 3a). Since higher customer sensitivity drives airlines to  improve the greening level, 

which  requires  investment,  airports  lend  their  support  to  the  airlines  by  reducing  CF. 

However, in the case of the CSC, CF increases with 𝜉, as airports already share a fraction of 

the increased investment costs. Due to higher CF, the greening level in CSC is lowest among 

all the contracts (Figure 3c). Further, we observe that in line with proposition 6, the greening 

sensitivity  of  passenger  (𝜉)  does  have  a  positive  impact  on  decision  variables  𝜃 𝑎𝑛𝑑 𝑝 

(Figures 3b, 3c). When 𝜉 is greater than the threshold (𝜉 > 2.8), the ticket fare in both LTT 

and RSC is  higher than  in  the D-CENT (Figure  3b). When  𝜉 is  equal  to  the threshold (𝜉 =

2.8), the ticket prices for RSC, LTT, and D-CENT are the same, but the demand is higher for 

coordinating  contracts  due  to  higher  greening  levels  (Figure  3c).  As  passengers  become 

environmentally conscious, the demand for green services increases with increasing greening 

image of the airline. Herein, the ticket fare is highest for CSC, as the airlines share 33% of 

greening costs with the airport, allowing thereby the latter to charge higher CF.  

Figure 3 (a, b, c): Conveyance fees, Ticket fare, Greening level vs Greening Sensitivity of Passengers 

 
6.2 Effects of greening cost per unit 

We now explore the influence of greening cost per unit, 𝐼, by varying 𝐼 from 10 to 50 

units. Figure 4 (a), (b), and (c) show the effects of 𝐼 on CF, the greening level and ticket fare. 

We  observe  that  higher  greening  costs (𝐼)  decrease  the  greening  level  (Figure  4(b)),  as  the 

airline becomes apprehensive about investing in greening due to its higher costs. The ticket 

fare also decreases with higher greening costs (Figure 4c), possibly owing to the fact that as 

airlines invest less in  greening due to higher costs, it may not be able to charge  a premium 

 

24 

from environmentally conscious passengers. The results thereby are in line with proposition 

7. Further, with higher greening cost, CF increases for LTT, RSC, and D-CENT, whereas it 

decreases  for  CSC.  This  increase  in  LTT,  RSC,  and  D-CENT  may  be  due  to  the  fact  that, 

higher  greening  cost  (𝐼)  leads  to  lower  greening  level,  and  lower  demand,  which  in  turn 

would decrease the airport’s non-aeronautical revenue. Therefore, the airport charges a higher 

CF to make up for its decrease in revenue. Furthermore, in case of RSC the revenue shared 

by airline also decreases due to lower demand, while for  LTT contract, the lump-sum tariff 

paid by airline decreases with 𝐼. Importantly, as increase in 𝐼 leads to reduced airline profit, 

the  lump-sum  tariff  transferred  to  the  airport  decreases  simultaneously.  Hence,  the  airport 

increases  CF  in  LTT,  RSC  and  D-CENT  in  order  to  compensate  for  the  reduced  revenue 

(Figure 4a). For CSC, lower greening level leads to lower total cost (𝐼𝜃2). Notably here, as 

the airport had shared a fraction of the greening cost, its own cost decreases, reducing thereby 

CF charged from the airline. 

Figure 4 (a, b, c): Conveyance fees, Greening level, Ticket fare vs. Greening cost parameter 

We find reduction in airport utility, airport pure profit, and airline profit with increase 

in per unit greening cost (𝐼) (Figure 5a, 5b, 5c). Additionally, we note that in Figure 5b, when 

𝐼 is less than a threshold, we find 𝜋𝐿𝑇𝑇

𝐴𝑃 > 𝜋𝑅𝑆𝐶
profit of RS contracts is higher than LTT:   𝜋𝑅𝑆𝐶

𝐴𝑃 ; however, if 𝐼 is higher than the threshold, the

6.3 Effect of CSR 

Now,  we  study  the  impact  of  the  airport’s  consumer  surplus  fraction  μ  on  the 

performance of the contracts. When the airport puts more weight on CSR (consumer surplus), 

its CF charged from the airline decrease (Figure 6a), also shown in proposition 8b,  

< 0.

This reduction in CF in turn enables the airline to consider more greening, which effectively 

results in higher passenger demands. Moreover, due to an increase in demand at upping the 

greening  level,  the  airline  is  able  to  charge  a  premium  (Figure  6b),  as  environmentally 

conscious  passengers  pay  higher  ticket  fares  for  greener  services.  This  in  turn  allows  the 

airline  to  earn  a  higher  profit  (Figure  7a).  Further,  we  find  that  in  LTT,  airport  utility 

(𝑈𝐴𝑃) and pure profit function  (𝜋 𝐴𝑃),   are conflicting in  nature; while  the former increases 

with μ, the latter decreases (Figures 7b, 7c). For LTT, a reduction in CF by airport reduces its 

pure  profit,  but  the  reduction  is  compensated  by  increase  in  tariff  that  it  collects  from  the 

airline.  As  the  airline  earns  higher  profit  with  increasing  μ,  but  it  keeps  only  the  reserved 

profit, remainder is transferred to the airport in terms of tariff. Notably here, lower CF leads 

to  higher  passenger  demand,  which  in  turn  increases  airports’  CSR,  leading  to  an  overall 

increase in 𝑈𝐴𝑃.

We  also  find  that  in  the  case  of  higher  values  of  μ  for  RSC  and  LTT,  CF  can  be 

negative, which signifies that the airport pays to the airline to invest in greening, and thereby 

increase its demand from environmentally-conscious passengers. However, this may not to be 

a practical scenario, because it destroys shareholder value with negative  aeronautical profits 

and higher CSR. Hence, we derive conditions to have non-negative pure profit, non-negative 

CF,  and  maximum  total  SW.  In  the  case  of  LTT,  for  instance,  we  note  that  the  airport  can 

earn 0 pure profit and maximise its utility for 𝜇 =0.31. For the values of 𝜇 > 0.31, the airport 

starts  incurring  losses.  Therefore,  the  airport’s  pure  aeronautical  profit  is  non-negative,  and 

utility  is  maximum  when  0  ≤ 𝜇 ≤ 0.31.  In  the  case  when  the  airline  increases  its  reserved 

 

27 

profit, the airport reduces its CSR contribution to make its pure profit non-negative. For RSC, 

when 𝜇 ≤ 0.165, the airport earns a non-negative profit.

Model  Extension:  Airport-airline  coordination  with  government 

intervention 

In this  section, we extend the aforementioned model  by  considering the  greening tax. 

Several governments have already started to implement stringent rules and regulations to curb 

emissions for the welfare of society at large (Giri et. al., 2019). In our case, the government 

imposes a tax on the airline to  capture the environmental  cost  to  society. The  collected tax 

revenue  is  generally  used  to  compensate  the  local  community  for  environmental  damages 

caused  by  the  airline  services.  Therefore,  the  inclusion  of  the  tax  policy  has  a  two-fold 

advantage;  first,  it  directly  targets  environmental  concerns  by  accounting  for  the 

environmental  cost  to  society  (Mankiw,  2007).  Second,  the  emission  tax may  stimulate  the 

airline  to  actively  implement  emission  reduction  strategies  to  achieve  the  desired  level  of 

greening.  Based  on  this,  we  formulate  a  three-stage  Stackelberg  game  involving  the 

government, airport, and the airline (Figure 8).  

Figure 8: Role of government in vertical coordination 

Our initial assumption of the airport as a leader and the airline the follower holds, while 

the government is an overall leader of the whole structure. Under the carbon tax regulation, 

the  environment-conscious  government  fixes  the  desired  level  of  greening  (𝜃0)  per  flight 

operation.  If  the  greening  level  of  an  airline  is  equal  to  𝑓. 𝜃0,    no  penalty  is  imposed. 

However,  if the level of greening by the airline (𝜃) is less than the desired level, a penalty 

equivalent  to  the  difference  between  𝑓. 𝜃0  and  𝜃  is  imposed.  The  severity  of  the  penalty 

depends on the tax level coefficient  ′𝑡′. The government tax revenue (GTR) generated from 

an airline for a tax level (𝑡 ≥ 0) is given by equation:  

𝐺𝑇𝑅 = 𝑡. (𝑓. 𝜃0 − 𝜃)+   
The government as an overall leader decides its tax level, and based on this, the airport 

(7) 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

decides on its conveyance fee (𝑤) to be charged from the airline. Finally, the airline moves 

last and decides on an optimal ticket fare (𝑝) and greening level (𝜃). As the airline incurs the 

taxation cost, the profit equation of airline is modified as: 

 

28 

𝑃𝑟𝑜𝑓𝑖𝑡 (𝜋 𝐴𝐿) = (𝑝. 𝑞) − (𝐼. 𝜃2 + 𝑐. 𝑓 + 𝑤. 𝑞 + 𝑞. 𝑐𝐴𝐿) − 𝐺𝑇𝑅 
 We  analyse  the  four  contract  settings  discussed  in  section  4,  and  present  numerical 

(8) 

 

 

analysis,  as  the  obtained  equilibrium  results  are  quite  large  and  too  complex  to  compare 

analytically (refer appendix B2 for solution approach). 

Figure 9: Government tax revenue vs Tax level 

The  government  tax  revenue  (GTR)  follows  a  concave  shape  (Figure  9).  Herein,  we 

observe that initially GTR increases with the tax level, reaches to a maximum level, and then 

begins to  decline.  However,  the rate of increase  in  tax revenue and the optimal tax level  is 

different  for  different  contract  types.  If  the  government  aims  to  maximise  its  tax  revenue, 

there is an optimum tax level  𝑡∗, which would maximise its revenue. The decrease in GTR 

after 𝑡∗ maybe accounted for the fact that at higher tax levels, it may be more beneficial for 

the  airline  to  invest  for  higher  greening  levels,  as  compared  to  simply  paying  taxes. 

Moreover, an increase in greening level also helps the airline by increasing its demand due to 

environment-conscious  passengers.  We  can  thereby  achieve  the  same  GTR  at  two  different 

tax  levels  due  to  the  concave  down  shape  of  the  GTR  function.  In  which  case,  the 

government would have to find a fine balance between tax revenue, desired greening level, 

and  profitability  of  the  airline.  We  discuss  below  the  taxation  for  non-coordinating  and 

coordinating contracts separately.

7.1. 

Tax in non-coordinating contracts 

Figure 10: Non-coordinating contract vs Tax level 

In  this  sub-section,  we  discuss  the  results  obtained  by  imposing  a  tax  on  the  airline 

under the non-coordinating contract  cases: D-CENT and CSC. We observe  a concave  GTR 

function and an increasing greening level (𝜃), along with an increase in the tax level (Figure 

10).  The  ticket  fare  also  increases  with  the  green  level  (Table  5).  The  airport  utility  (𝑈 𝐴𝑃) 

increases  with  tax  level  for    D-CENT  setting.  However,  in  the  case  of  CSC,  the  airport’s 

utility curve has a downward slope at a higher tax level. This  may be explained by the fact 

that  the  higher  values  of  𝜃  leads  to  higher  investment  costs,  which  needs  to  be  shared 

between  both  the  airport  and  the  airline.  The  increase  in  greening  investment  cost-sharing 

leads in turn to a decrease in the utility of the airport. On the other hand, higher cost-sharing 

offsets  higher  revenue,  cloaked  by  an  increase  in  passenger  demand.  However,  under  D-

CENT  setting,  𝑈𝐴𝑃 has  an  increasing  slope,  as  the  airport  does  not  bear  any  greening  cost, 

but  reaps  the  benefits  associated with  an  increase in  demand due to  environment-conscious 

passengers. As expected, we see a fall in the airline’s profit with increasing tax level for both 

D-CENT  and  CSC  contracts.  The  higher  tax  level  forces  the  airline  to  undertake  more 

greening,  which  further  increases  its  investment  costs.  The  diminishing  rate  of  return  of 

greening,  combined  with  higher  investment  cost,  along  with  greening  tax  makes  the  airline 

incur a heavy loss at higher tax levels. Hence, even though taxation helps in improving the 

environmental performance of the airline, and achieve the planet aspect  of TBL, it destroys 

the economic value of the airline per se.

Increasing  tax  levels  leads  to  higher  greening  in  coordinating  contracts,  i.e.  RSC  and 

LTT.  However,  the  airport  utility  and  airline  profit  have  varying  characteristics  due  to 

different  contract  properties.  In  RSC,  the  airport  receives  a  fraction  of  revenue  from  the 

airline in exchange for low CF. Notably, lower CF along with higher greening levels leads to 

an  increase  in  passenger  demand.  Subsequently,  higher  passenger  footfall  results  in  higher 

earning for the airport, from both aeronautical and non-aeronautical revenues, leading thereby 

to an increase in the utility of the airport. However, when the tax regime has higher greening 

level  and  ticket  fare,  θ𝑅𝑆𝐶_𝑇 > θ𝑅𝑆𝐶,  𝑝𝑅𝑆𝐶_𝑇 > 𝑝𝑅𝑆𝐶,  we  note  that  π𝑅𝑆𝐶

𝐴𝐿 > π𝑅𝑆𝐶_𝑇

𝐴𝐿

  due  to  tax 

(subscript  _𝑇   represents  with  tax  case).  Also,  total  SW  (π𝑅𝑆𝐶_𝑇

𝐴𝐿 + U𝑅𝑆𝐶_𝑇

𝐴𝑃 + GTR𝑅𝑆𝐶_𝑇) 

decreases with tax, leading to deteriorating channel efficiency.   

In the case of LTT contract, the airline keeps a constant profit and transfers the rest to 

the airport as a lump sum tariff. Under the tax regime, it transfers lower tariffs to the airport 

due to lower profit and higher taxation. Hence, the utility of the airport decreases even with 

higher passenger footfall and greening level of the airline. In both the contracts, we observe 

𝑤 > 𝑤𝑇,  (Table  5),  which  may  be  explained  by  the  fact  that  under  tax  regime,  the  airline 

increases its greening, while the airport supports the airline’s greening initiatives by lowering 

its conveyance fee. Further, the airport compensates its lower CF with an increase in revenue 

from  non-aeronautical  fees  due  to  higher  demand  with  greening.  Meanwhile,  the  airline’s 

profit decreases with a higher tax level, as it suffers a double blow from  the tax and higher 

 

31 

greening  investment  costs.  The  combined  expense  naturally  leads  the  airline  to  become  a 

loss-making entity. 

 

Figure 11: Coordinating contract vs Tax level 

Our  results  have  generated  some  interesting  findings  as  regards  government 

intervention.  For  instance,  we  find  that  the  ticket  fare  and  greening  level  of  an  airline 

increases  with  the  tax  level  for  all  type  of  contracts.  The  role  that  tax  regulation  plays  in 

terms of the greening level and welfare improvement is affected by the investment coefficient 

parameter of the airline. On comparing the results of coordinating contracts without tax to the 

decentralised  case  with  tax,  the  results  obtained  are  interesting  and  presented  in  following 

proposition.  

Proposition 9: We observe that 𝜃𝑅𝑆𝐶_𝑇 = 𝜃𝐿𝑇𝑇_𝑇 > 𝜃𝑅𝑆𝐶 = 𝜃𝐿𝑇𝑇 > 𝜃𝐶𝑆𝐶_𝑇 > 𝜃𝐷−𝐶𝐸𝑁𝑇_𝑇. 

The result implies  that  even after imposing tax in the non-coordinating contracts  (D-CENT 

and CSC), the greening level is less than that of coordinating contracts even without tax.  

We  conclude  that  coordination  can  help  in  achieving  a  higher  greening  level,  as 

compared to imposing a tax in the non-coordinating cases. We also note that the airport utility 

increases up to a certain level of tax for almost all contracts (except in the case of LTT). The 

increase may be explained by the fact that the rise in greening level leads to higher passenger 

demands and hence higher revenue for the airport. Furthermore, the leader (airport) is able to 

respond  to  the  follower’s  decisions  of  higher  greening  by  reducing  conveyance  fees  to 

support the airline to reduce its expenses in case of coordinating contracts (RSC and LTT).  

Further, we show that an optimal tax level could be used as a regulatory mechanism for 

reducing emissions; but precautions should be taken, as it hurts the airline’s profitability. The 

government can use the tax revenue earned for the welfare of the local community, which is 

 

32 

affected by the negative externality of airline movements in the city.  We also show that the 

tax revenue, profit of the airport, airline, and overall SW are all influenced by the investment 

coefficient  parameter,  tax  level,  and  greening  sensitivity  of  passengers.  Therefore,  in 

designing the greening tax, it is critical to consider the effect of these parameters. Moreover, 

the tax revenue also depends on the contract between the airport and the airline. Our results 

reveal  that  tax  revenue  earned  under  coordinating  contract  is  lower  than  non-coordinating 

contract,  as  airlines  undertake  higher  greening  in  RSC  and  LTT  contract.  The  optimal 

decision on the greening level is mainly influenced by the investment cost coefficients of the 

airline. The optimal tax would encourage both the airport and the airline to work together to 

increase investments in green technologies, and to reduce emissions thereof.  

8. Impact of greening and price competition between airlines  

In  this  section  we  extend  our  model  to  include  discussion  of  horizontal  competition 

between two airlines. We focus on studying competition between two airlines and its effect 

on airport utility, airline profit, ticket fare and greening level.  

8.1 Pricing competition between the airlines 

We  start  our  analysis  by  assuming  pricing  competition  between  two  airlines  from  a 

single airport, providing similar services to a common market. For example,  two prominent 

Indian domestic careers Indigo and SpiceJet operating out of their Delhi airport.   We assume 

that  both  airlines  make  decision  regarding  ticket  fare  and  greening  level  simultaneously. 

Thus, the setting deals with two heterogeneous airline and monopolistic airport (Choi, 1996).  

We  analyse  the  decentralised  and  revenue  sharing  contract  case.  The  market  size  is 

fixed  as  𝛼,  and  the  passenger  sensitivity  to  airline’s  green  service  is  captured  by  𝜉.  The 

pricing  competition  between  the  airlines  is  exhibited  with  different  price  sensitivity  of 

passengers,  represented  by  different  substitutability  coefficients  𝛽1 𝑎𝑛𝑑 𝛽2.  Thereby,  the 

demand functions for the two airlines are, 𝑞1 = 𝛼 − 𝛽𝑝1 + 𝜉𝜃1 + 𝛽1𝑝2 and 𝑞2 = 𝛼 − 𝛽𝑝2 +
𝜉𝜃2 + 𝛽2𝑝1.  α  is  the  market  potential,  while   and i is  the  own  price  and  cross-price 
sensitivity of passengers, respectively and 0 1  𝑎𝑛𝑑 02 holds. The demand function 
of airline 𝑖 decreases with its own ticket fare 𝑝𝑖 while increases in competitor's ticket fare 𝑝𝑗. 

i.e.  passenger’s  cross  price  sensitivity.  This  demand  equation  helps  in  modelling  the 

influences of ticket fare competition of the airlines. 

For  decentralised  case,  the  airlines’  profit  functions  are  𝜋1

𝜉𝜃1 + 𝛽1𝑝2) − 𝐼𝜃1

2 and  𝜋2

𝐴𝐿 = (𝑝 − 𝑤)(𝛼 − 𝛽𝑝2 + 𝜉𝜃2 + 𝛽2𝑝1) − 𝐼𝜃2

𝐴𝐿 = (𝑝 − 𝑤)(𝛼 − 𝛽𝑝1 +

first  order  derivative  with  respect 

to  𝑝1, 𝑝2, θ1𝑎𝑛𝑑 θ2.  On  solving 

the  equations

𝜉((𝛽−𝛽2)𝑤𝜉2–4𝛽𝐼(𝛽𝑤−𝑎)–𝑎𝜉2+2𝑎𝛽2𝐼+2𝛽1𝐼𝑤(𝛽+𝛽1))

and 

,  while  the  optimal  greening  level  are  𝜃1 =

𝑝1 =

𝑝2 =

𝜃2 =

.  Further, 

for 

the  airport, 

the  optimal 

conveyance fees charged can be found by substituting equilibrium ticket fare and green level 

value into profit equation and solving the first order derivative.  

Analysis  of  the  result  reveals  the  symmetry  in  optimal  values  obtained.  From  the 

optimal  values  of  ticket  fare,  we  observe  that    𝑝1 − 𝑝2 =

(2𝐼(𝛽1–𝛽2))
(−𝜉2+4𝛽𝐼+2𝛽2𝐼)+1

,  which  indicates 

that  the  ratio  is  dependent  only  on  difference  between  cross  price  sensitivity  of  passengers 

𝛽1 𝑎𝑛𝑑 𝛽2. Similarly, 𝜃1 − 𝜃2 =

𝛽(2𝐼𝑤−𝑤𝜉2+2𝑎𝐼)(𝛽1−𝛽2)
(𝑎+(𝛽2−𝛽)𝑤)𝜉2−4𝛽2𝐼𝑤+4𝑎𝛽𝐼+2𝐼𝛽2(𝑎+𝑤(𝛽+𝛽1))+1

; wherein equal 

price  sensitivity  of  passengers  leads  to   

= 1 𝑎𝑛𝑑 the  ratio  is  independent  of  other 

𝜃1
𝜃2

parameters.  Thus,  with  equal  price  sensitivity,  both  airlines  charges  similar  ticket  fare  and 

under similar level of greening, while 𝑝1 > 𝑝2 for β1 > β2. On further analysis, we obtain the 

difference of optimal ticket fare and greening level leading to following proposition: 

Proposition 10: For D-CENT contract in pricing competition between two airlines, 

the difference between ticket fare and greening level of two airlines is increasing 

function of  𝛽1;  (

𝜕(𝑝𝑖−𝑝𝑗)
𝜕𝛽𝑖

> 0; 

𝜕(𝜃𝑖−𝜃𝑗)
𝜕𝜃𝑖

> 0), i.e. the difference between the ticket fare 

and greening level increases if  𝐼 > 𝜉2/4𝛽 + 2𝛽𝑖 and I> 𝑤𝜉2/2(𝛼 + 𝛽𝑤). 

For  revenue  sharing  case,  the  profit  function  of  airlines  changes  to  𝜋𝑖 = 𝑟𝑖𝑝𝑖𝑞𝑖 −
2, while  the  profit  function  of  airport  is  𝜋𝐴𝑃 = (𝑤 + 1)(𝑞1 + 𝑞2) − 𝑐𝐴𝑃(𝑞1 +
𝑤𝑞𝑖 − 𝐼𝜉𝑖
𝑞2) + (1 − 𝑟1)𝑝1𝑞1 + (1 − 𝑟2)𝑝2𝑞2. The  optimal  values  of  ticket  fare  and  greening  level 

of  airlines,  with  assumption  of  equal  RCF  are  found 

to  be  as  follows  𝑝i =

(−𝑟𝑖𝜉2+4𝛽𝐼+2𝛽1𝐼)(−𝑟𝑖𝑤𝜉2+2𝛼𝐼𝑟𝑖+2𝛽𝐼𝑤)
𝑟𝑖((𝜉2−4𝛽𝐼)2−4𝛽1𝛽2𝐼2)

;  𝜃𝑖 =

𝐼(4𝛽(𝛼𝑟𝑖−𝛽𝑤)+2𝛽1(𝛼𝑟𝑖+𝑤(𝛽+𝛽𝑗)))𝜉−(𝛼𝑟𝑖

2−(𝛽−𝛽𝑖)𝑟𝑖𝑤)𝜉3

(𝑟𝑖𝜉2−4𝛽𝐼)2−4𝛽𝑖𝛽𝑗𝐼2

. 

The optimal conveyance fee is obtained by substituting the equilibrium values into objective 

function of airport and equating first order derivative w.r.t w to 0. 

Analysis  of  the  result  shows  that  the  optimal  conveyance  fee  charged  by  the  airport 

decreases with higher CSR coefficient, which is in line with our above findings (Figure 12). 

 

34 

We also observe increase in greening level of the airlines, both in decentralised and revenue 

sharing case, with increasing profit while the utility of airport decreases due to higher CSR. 

In  case  of  revenue  sharing  contract,  we  find  increase  in  conveyance  fees  charged  by  the 

airport  when  RCF  is  low,  i.e.  when  airlines  share  lower  revenue.  Numerical  analysis  by 

varying  passenger  greening  sensitivity  shows  decrease  in  conveyance  fees  of  airport  with 

increasing  greening  level.  We  also  observe  increase  in  profit  of  airlines  and  airport  with 

higher  greening  level.  The  profit  of  airport  is  higher  in  case  of  RSC,  as  airlines  share  a 

fraction of their revenue with airport, in return of lower conveyance fees as observed in figure 

13.

8.2 Greening competition between the airlines 

To  further  understand  the  impact  of  competition  on  being  more  environmentally 

conscious  image,  we  examine  the  competition  between  two  airlines  undertaking  greening 

investment  under decentralised  and  revenue sharing case. Our previous assumptions of two 

competing  airlines  and  a  monopolistic  airport  holds.  We  capture  the  greening  competition 

among airlines by the following demand equation 𝑞1 = 𝛼 − 𝛽𝑝1 + 𝜉𝜃1 − 𝜉1𝜃2and 𝑞2 = 𝛼 −

𝛽𝑝2 + 𝜉𝜃2 + 𝜉2𝜃1.  The  market  size  is  fixed  as  𝛼,  and  the  passenger’s  price  sensitivity  is 

captured  by  𝛽.  The  greening  competition  between  the  airlines  is  exhibit  with  different 

passenger’s  greening  sensitivity,  represented  by  different  substitutability  coefficients 

𝜉1 𝑎𝑛𝑑 𝜉2.  The  profit  equation  of  airlines  and  airport  remains  the  same  for  both  the  de-

centralised and revenue sharing case. We solve the model using backward induction, wherein 

we first obtain the optimal ticket fare and greening level of airlines by first order derivative 

and then solve airport’s objective function.  

For de-centralised case, the optimal ticket fare and greening level for both the airlines 

are 

as 

obtained, 

𝑝𝑖 =

2𝐼𝜉(𝑤𝜉𝑖𝛽−𝑎(𝜉+𝜉𝑖))+(8𝛽𝐼2(𝑎+𝑤𝛽)−𝑤𝜉2(6𝛽𝐼−𝜉2+𝜉𝑖𝜉𝑗)
(𝜉2−4𝛽𝐼)2−𝜉𝑖𝜉𝑗𝜉2

 

and 

𝜃𝑖 =

𝜉(𝑤𝛽−𝛼)(𝜉2−4𝐼𝛽+𝜉𝑖𝜉)
(𝜉2−4𝛽𝐼)2−𝜉𝑖𝜉𝑗𝜉2

.  Analytical  analysis  reveals  that  𝑝1 − 𝑝2 =

2𝐼𝜉(𝜉2−𝜉1)(𝛼−𝛽𝑤)

16𝛽2I2−8𝛽𝐼𝜉2+𝜉4−𝜉1𝜉2𝜉2,  and 

𝜉2(𝜉2−𝜉1)(𝛼−𝛽𝑤)

θ1 − θ2 =

16𝛽2𝐼2−8𝛽𝐼𝜉2+𝜉4−𝜉1𝜉2𝜉2. We  observe  that  when  𝜉𝑗 > 𝜉𝑖;  i.e.  passengers  are  more 
sensitive  towards  greening  of  airline  j,  the  difference  𝜃1 −  𝜃2 is  positive,  i.e.  airlines 

 

36 

undertake  higher  greening  and  charge  higher  ticket  fare.  Further,  we  observe  similar  trend 

with decreasing conveyance fees and higher profit and greening level for airlines with higher 

CSR. It is interesting to note that utility of airport first decreases and then increases with CSR 

coefficient.  Similar  results  are  obtained  with  passenger’s  greening  coefficient,  as  higher 

sensitivity leads to higher greening effort put by airlines. On further analysis, we obtain the 

difference of optimal ticket fare and greening level leading to following proposition: 

Proposition  11:  For  D-CENT  contract  in  greening  competition  between  two  airlines, 

the difference between ticket fare and greening level of two airlines is increasing function of

Thus,  the  similarity  in  the  results  obtained  with  duopoly  airline  market  and  single 

airline  market  under  both  pricing  and  greening  competition  reflect  the  robustness  of  result 

obtained in previous section.

competition 

In  this  study,  we  considered  airline-airport  coordination  model;  with  and  without 

government 

intervention.  The  airline  undertakes  greening 

investments 

to  provide 

environment-friendly  service,  and  the  airport  is  engaged  in  CSR  activity.  They  can  jointly 

achieve triple bottom line (TBL) growth. The government could act as an overall leader for 

both  the  airport-airline  coordination  model,  and  collect  taxes  for  emission  reduction,  while 

catering  to  the  welfare  of  the  local  community.  Our  results  indicate  that  a  linear  two-part 

tariff and a revenue-sharing contract are best-suited to coordinate a decentralised structure by 

incorporating  the  TBL  elements.  These  contracts  provide  an  incentive  for  the  airport  to 

improve  CSR,  and  focus  on  overall  utility  maximisation.  Further,  the  contract  provides  an 

opportunity  for the airline to achieve its environmental goals, while increasing the greening 

level  by  sharing  the  financial  risks  involved  with  the  airport.  We  believe  that  such  an 

analytical framework in the airline industry has not been reported before. Below we present 

some of the major findings of the paper along with their managerial and policy implications.

  We have demonstrated the effectiveness of RSC and LTT 

contracts in achieving the growth. These contracts coordinate 
the channel like a centralised case, and improves the greening 
level (planet), maximises social welfare (people) and profit. We 
also explored CSC and D-Cent contracts and concluded that 
these contracts do not coordinate with the centralised case to 
provide optimal results. 

  The results obtained in the study show that mutual 

support between the airport and an airline can improve the 
greening level, attract more environmentally conscious 
passengers, increase the profitability of the airline and utility of 
the airport. On comparing the results of coordinating contracts 
with the D-Cent case, we note that coordination does help both 
the airport and the airline to improve their utility and profit 
goals.

funds towards greening investment. In return, the airline shares 
a fraction of revenue (RSC) or pays a tariff (LTT) to the airport 
in order to compensate for its losses due to lower CF. Overall, 
the channel’s SWE and GE increases. Resultantly, collaboration 
and cooperation between the airport and airline to make a 
cleaner environment improves, also enhancing in turn the 
aspect of social welfare. 

 

 

 

The equilibrium results and propositions discussed, 
could help both airport and airline managers to choose the 
optimal values of the parameters to achieve TBL growth. 
Results under different scenarios that have been discussed 
would help managers gain better insights. 

When an airline undertakes greening responsibility, and 
the airport considers social welfare, mutual coordination in the 
form of LTT and RSC could help both the parties improve 
their objectives. A lack of coordination on the other hand, may 
be resolved by choosing suitable contract terms through which 
the airport-airline could enhance interaction with each other.

airline managers, it is viable to share the risk of greening 
investment with the airport to reduce the burden of greening 
costs by considering suitable contract terms with the airports.

airline’s own profit, and the airport’s utility, which in turn 
enhances the social welfare. The investment cost parameter 
does play an important role in the airline greening level, and 
hence the system’s performance. There is an optimal level of 
greening for the airline with and without government 
intervention, which effectively maximises its profit. In the 
model, with government intervention, we also have an optimal 
tax level, which guarantees a certain level of greening while 
ensuring a positive profit of the airline.  

On varying passenger sensitivity, we observe higher 
profit for both the airport and airline with increasing sensitivity. 
The increasing consumer sensitivity also has an increasing 
impact on the ticket fare, CF, and greening level of the airline. 
The optimal greening level is higher for coordinating contracts 
and in the tax regime. However, airline’s profit decreases in tax 
regime as it undertakes higher investment which results in a 
negative marginal impact.  

 

  We conclude that as the airport increases its CSR 
commitment, it offers CF below the marginal operating cost in 
coordinating contracts. Both contracts (RSC and LTT) achieve 
equal SWE, with increasing airline profit with the airport’s 
CSR. Since the numerical results obtained are for a constant 
value of revenue sharing fraction, we find reduced airport 
profit, as the revenue shared by the airline is not enough to 
compensate for the loss in airport revenue due to lower CF.  

Our results also show that CSR improves channel 

However, the results obtained indicate that the implementation 
of TBL increases both the airport and the airline’s profit. 
Therefore, managers should be motivated to put more effort 
into both greening and CSR. To obtain the highest level of 
greening, mangers should consider either LTT or RSC 
contract. Therefore, using the results obtained, managers can 
derive the optimal greening level, CF and tax level for different 
settings. The airline could develop an appropriate ticket price 
mechanism to maximise channel performance. 

Results also indicate that it is viable for the airline, 
airport, and government to invest in increasing the consumers’ 
awareness about the greening performance of the airline. These 
can be accomplished through advertisements and promotional 
activities.  In the case of tax regime, the revenue earned by the 
government can be used for the welfare of the local 
community. The government can even help the airline in 
improving its greening level by providing funds to invest in 
environmental innovations. 

  The study reveals that for a socially concerned airport 
with a focus on CSR, the CF charged should be low to generate 
passenger demand by lower ticket prices. The airport should 
focus on earning profit from higher non-aeronautical revenue 
due to increased demand, thereby subsidising aeronautical 
revenue to promote greening.   

However, we find a decrease in the pure profit of the 
airport as it focuses more on CSR. A CSR-oriented airport 
should decide to what extent it pays ‘to be good', and beyond

what level it should 'not to be too good'. Overall, our findings 
suggest that a contract can be an important source for welfare 
improvement based on the objective of the airport. Airports 
also play a role in sharing risk associated with the greening 
investment with the airline, and hence promote green service. 
The airport authorities stand to gain, as passenger footfall 
increase with the greening level of the airline. 

What is the role of government intervention in achieving economic, environmental, and social progress in the aviation sector?  Finally, 

taxation is one policy measure that governments can use for carbon emissions reduction, especially in the case of non-coordinating airline-airport contract. To 

achieve the environmental and social progress, fundamentally, we need firms to work together under contract, and achieve higher CSR and greening level 

by investing in green technologies to reduce their emissions. However, in the case of inefficient contract types (D-CENT, CSC), the government can resort to 

taxation to promote the higher greening initiatives. In the case of efficient contract (RSC, LTT) with a higher level of greening, on one hand, taxation does 

increase the greening level, but on the other hand, it is detrimental to overall contract performance. Our findings indicate that firms’ optimal decision on green 

technology  investment  is  mainly  influenced  by  their  emission  cost  reduction  strategy.  Furthermore,  from  the  perspective  of  policymakers,  our  research 

findings provide interesting insights into how the tax level can affect the economic and environmental performances of the entire structure. As opposed to the 

belief of a single tax strategy for all our findings demonstrate it is efficient to have it different for contract types. Unique characteristics of the contracts (e.g. 

cost-sharing or revenue sharing) should be considered in the development of the taxation scheme. Furthermore, good use of tax revenue is equally important 

to reduce the externality faced by the local community in the form of poor air quality and higher noise levels due to airline operations. When deciding the use 

of revenue, policymakers should consider the greening investment of airlines and develop incentives for airlines to invest in green technologies that can help 

to further reduce carbon emissions. Our findings also suggest a fundamental trade-off between economic efficiency and environmental sustainability.  It is 

crucial  for  policymakers  to  balance this  and  other  trade-offs  considering  the importance  of air  travel, and the immediate and  the  long-term  economic  and 

environmental challenges of the aviation sector at large. Finally, taxation should be used in combination with coordinating contracts. Based on our analysis,

Future  research  could  explore  our  proposed  models  by  relaxing  some  assumptions,  such  as 

competition  between  the  airports  and  airlines.  We  have  considered  only  one  tax  structure.  Future 

studies  could  explore  different  tax  structures  such  as  cap  and  trade,  and  the  combined  effect  of 

coordination.  We  also  recommend  exploring  the  results  in  stochastic  demand  and  a  multi-period 

setting. Importantly, in addition to the findings above, we do acknowledge the importance of factors 

such as trust, the risks involved, along with the issues of implementation in choosing the best contract.
